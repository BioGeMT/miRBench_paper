# Note on datasets used for getting plots

The input datasets for the plots are the output files from the `postprocess_0_filter_and_deduplicate.sh` script as part of the postprocess series of pipelines, i.e. files with `.filtered.deduplicated.tsv` suffix. Refer to ../post_process/README.md for where to download input files for the `postprocess_0_filter_and_deduplicate.sh` script, and how to run the scripts to get the required intermediate files to be used as input to the scripts in the current (plots/) directory.
